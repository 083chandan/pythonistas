#### Question

**Given a set of words & a miss-spelled input, write a function which will find 3 words from the dictionary which are closest (by difference of 1-character) to the given input.**

eg - words_set = {vil, sit, flick, pat, pluck, sat, vat}, 

input = vit 

Output --> {sit, vil, vat}


As always, try to write optimized code with least time complexity possible and for heavier inputs.
